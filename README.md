# [DotaVision](https://t.me/VisionGuru_bot) - Dota 2 Match Prediction Bot

## How It Works
The bot uses a machine learning model trained on past Dota 2 matches. It constantly checks for new live Dota 2 matches and predicts their outcomes based on drafts. The bot also regularly updates these predictions and their results on a dedicated [Telegram channel](https://t.me/dota_vision). The statistics are available via bot interface or in [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dsQ_1ljNI1oVk5yzjbD-6fQR-7CvHcUKPVNo05PSzrU/edit#gid=0)
